1. Create a a custom content provider with an underlying SQL database (Create any database with at least 5 columns and 10 rows) 
2. Retrieve data from that content provider and populate the recyclerView
3. Use VectorDrawable to create an image using an xml
4. Create a button behavior using StateListDrawable
5. Add 2 Fragments statically and Log.d each lifecycle
6. Create a Master/Detail Application

## Research ##
#### Distinguish between dynamic and static for fragments ####
* Static fragments are declared in the xml layout file.
* Dynamic fragments are added through code using fragment manager to insert into a container view group.
